# N-queens

# First, run with installing in your terminal idle3
      sudo apt-get install idle3

# Then, to set a new file in the idle3
     press f5 to create the file and save the file

After to check if the code works you can either run it in the terminal or directly in the idle3
 # In the command line:
  1. Fork and clone the repository 
  2. Go to command line
  3. In command line go into the folder you have the file in  
  4.then run python stephanie.py
    EXAMPLE:
      python (name of file)
         ex: python LEARN.PY
         

In the file it will show you the code running.
Or if you install pyCharm you are also able to run your code step by step.
It will show you all the solutions that are possible.

These are the resources I used for this code:
  this is where i got the syntax in python and learned a little about it.
